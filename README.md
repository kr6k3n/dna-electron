# Simple DNA Sequence comparison App

Made this to run dna comparison on my own computer real fast.

## Installation

You can either download the app pre-built or build it yourself

### Download packaged app 
Go to the [releases](https://github.com/kr6k3n/dna-electron/releases) page and download the version for your Os (only mac os built for the moment)

### Build it yourself

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kr6k3n/dna-electron && cd dna-electron && npm install && npm run-script build
```
