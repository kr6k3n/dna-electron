# Simple DNA Sequence comparison App made with Love and Electron

Made this to run dna comparison on my own computer rather than on the server of the app that school gives us. Fun project!

## Installation

You can either download the app pre-built or build it yourself

### Download packaged app 
Go to the [releases](https://github.com/kr6k3n/dna-electron/releases) page and download the version for your Os (only mac os supported for the moment)

## Build it yourself

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kr6k3n/dna-electron && cd dna-electron && npm install && npm run-script build
```
